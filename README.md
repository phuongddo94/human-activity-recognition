# Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Data
Machine learning projects for HAR data set from UCI

In this project, I use the data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The objective of this project is to use different machine learning methods to classify human activity based on various sensor signals generated by smartphone.
